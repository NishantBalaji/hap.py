# hap.py
Too lazy to find some funny jokes? hap.py is here to help! hap.py is a one stop facial recognition software that will send you the greatest (and most appropriate) memes based on your mood and age. On top of that, memes will be sent straight to your phone, allowing you to be connected with the top memes at your convenience. 

## Inspiration
Whenever we feel happy, sad, angry, or anything in between, memes can provide the necessary moral support to make your day one thousand times better. But how could we make memes *even better*? Ever since we have been stuck at home, finding shortcuts to every day problems has been essential. That's where facial recognition can come in! Having a mood-detecting software that **also** sends you memes would be the perfect combination to satisfy your everyday needs.
